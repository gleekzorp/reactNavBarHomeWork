**Build out a new react project with a navbar!**

- Create a new react project using `js-generate` and select `react-redux-router` and name it navigationProject
- create a remote git repo and push up your project. I want the link to your finished repo in the morning
- Make sure not to push up your `node_modules`
- Create at least 4 components. One of them needs to work with state
- Create a navbar using react router dom.
- Create links to each component you created
- Should be able to navigate throughout your app without the page refreshing
- Inside of your component where you can use state, create the counter that we build earlier today. I donâ€™t care what your other components consist of.
